Pirate Intelligent Agent Project
This repository contains the code and reflections for the Pirate Intelligent Agent project, showcasing how reinforcement learning and neural networks were used to solve a real-world pathfinding problem. The project is part of my coursework in reinforcement learning and neural networks, and this README includes reflections on the project’s significance in the broader field of computer science.

Project Summary
In this project, I implemented a pirate-themed intelligent agent designed to navigate a maze and locate treasure using a deep Q-learning algorithm. The code provided a foundational structure, including the setup of the environment and an outline for training the agent. I built upon this structure, implementing a deep Q-learning model, tuning the exploration-exploitation balance, and developing the agent's reward system. Through this work, the agent learned optimal strategies to efficiently find the treasure, demonstrating the power of reinforcement learning in pathfinding scenarios.

Connection to Computer Science
This project emphasizes core principles in computer science, particularly in the areas of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and algorithm design. Computer scientists aim to solve complex problems by developing algorithms that can interpret, learn from, and act upon data. This work contributes to fields ranging from robotics to game development and autonomous navigation.

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them into manageable steps, applying logical reasoning, and experimenting with various techniques to refine the solution. In this project, for instance, I used systematic exploration and evaluation of different hyperparameters to optimize the agent’s performance, applying the same iterative problem-solving approach that is common in software development and AI.

Ethical Responsibilities
An essential part of computer science is considering the ethical implications of our work. As we design intelligent agents or algorithms, we must ensure that they are developed and used responsibly. For this project, that means considering the impact of the technology on the user experience and making sure the agent behaves in predictable and fair ways. Furthermore, transparency and accuracy in training data, avoiding biases, and prioritizing user privacy are essential ethical responsibilities to both users and the organization. This experience highlights the need to develop AI responsibly, making sure that the algorithms we create serve to benefit users and society at large.
